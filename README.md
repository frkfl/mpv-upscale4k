### üß≠ Overview

The **Best 4K for mpv, whatever the source** is a complete solution to drag & drop to upscale to 4K from any sources. No setting required. No tuning. Throw it your worst.

It is a collection of GLSL shaders and profiles for **mpv** that reconstruct perceptual video quality from **240p to 1080p sources** ‚Äî turning noisy, compressed footage into a **stable, filmic 4K experience** as much as possible, extracting the most information possible from each pixel. The configuration files take care of selecting the right process, cleaning process are auto-tuned.

In addition to a classic Neural upscaler, this project:
- Restores texture and tone without fabricating detail  
- Uses entropy, color fidelity, and analog simulation
- Fix analog problems like chroma bleeding and many other
- Provide a full chain of numerical restoration tuned for each resolution
- Runs fully in real time on modern GPUs (tested on RTX 3080)

The result will depends on the source material, but every source will get every hint of information squeeze to give the best details in 4K

Expect
- Surpringly watchable old camera records
- Excellent rendering from 720p, with no blur a little artifact, but not that detailed
- Almost 4K full quality from an average/mediocrer 1080p video

# üéûÔ∏è Analog Restoration Chain for mpv
### *Rebuilding lost image quality through patient, layered refinement.*

---

## üìú Overview
This project provides a collection of GLSL shaders and mpv profiles designed to **restore perceptual quality** to low-resolution, heavily compressed video (480p or less) ‚Äî without hallucinating fake detail.  
It works by **deconstructing compression artifacts**, **restoring analog structure**, and **re-stitching tone, color, and texture** into a stable, film-like result.

Think: *a good DVD player feeding a high-end CRT ‚Äî but in 4K.*

## üß© Design Philosophy
> ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt reinvent pixels ‚Äî let them remember how they used to look.‚Äù

### Core principles
1. **No recreation, only reconstruction**  
   Filters derive structure from artifact patterns, not neural guesswork.
2. **Entropy before collapse**  
   Controlled grain and CRT emulation break compression regularities.
3. **Layered linearity**  
   All passes operate in float-linear (RGBA16F) space to avoid posterization.
4. **Perceptual correction, not perfection**  
   A slightly soft, coherent image is preferable to brittle digital sharpness.
5. **Temporal calm**  
   A single stabilizer (TXAA-lite, temporal blend, or sharpen-decay) maintains visual stability.

## Compatibility

# Hardware

## Geforce 3080 RTX

This is simply the GPU I am using.
For HD content, it is extremely light, in memory, I get 10% use of the GPU. I tested the code once on a 1070 GTX, no problems.
For old VHS-like video, it is much heavier. 20~30% range.
But there is no AI, so no problem with a 2070 I would assume.

## No heavy process

So there is almost nothing heavy in the code. Nothing in the code I wrote.
Most code are pixel per pixel work, parallelized in the GPU : Even 4K work is super fast.

3 things are heavy:

1 - FSRCNXX is heavy.

It is the "AI upscaler". But there is nothing AI in it.
A neural network (they are sometimes called AI) trained on a tons of videos and that gave a list of magic numbers.
Like : 0.0075713125988841, use that here in your calculation. It's a very topic on itself.

These numbers used in mathematical calculations (matrices) to give the best improvement.
So the number are hard coded, there is no AI looking at your picture.
But it is a multi pass, complex, heavy on math process.


So it is hard to guarantee anything else than that it works on my PC lol
I have a Geforce RTX 3080. 

2 - Nlmeans is heavy

It is a quality improver. How to make the picture cleaner without making it weird, with block, or blur.
And I nead it for low resolution video. But I have a trick, I apply in intermediary resolution : 1080p

3 - My own code.

So far, nothing is really heavy, each shader is often 0.5ms.
But I already have 20 shaders. That's why it's heavy. So many things to fix.

Did you know that old sources have signal interference in the cable between color and light?
Well, that's why the colors come out disgusting.
It can be detected and partially fixed. But it's a few passes, you get more in the 1~3ms territory.
And you have like 40 ms to generate a frame. And you would rather do it in 10 ms so that you don't need a Geforce 3080 running at 100%.

# Processing

## Analog-domain repairs

This is the full analog defect spectrum that actually exists in VHS, DV, VCD, and early digital transfers.
Only used for resolution around 480p. It is fairly neutral for non analog sources (a DVD VOB).
But I don't really see the point of risking a 1080p picture with analog fixes.

| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Y/C subcarrier phase drift          | Analog bandwidth + delay mismatch | ‚úÖ Corrected (directional realignment `shift_px`, `k_strength`)  |
| One-way chroma bleed                | Filter asymmetry in tape playback | ‚úÖ Modeled by sign(Gy * ŒîC), directional and weighted            |
| Cross-talk Y‚ÜîC energy               | Shared signal path interference   | ‚úÖ Rebalanced via Œ±/Œ≤ feedback                                   |
| Temporal flicker (luma gain wobble) | AGC instability, tape modulation  | ‚úÖ Stabilized via deterministic EMA-like temporal smoothing      |
| Shadow color cast / chroma noise    | Subcarrier amplitude loss         | ‚úÖ Neutralized by tone gate + chroma attenuation below threshold |
| Chroma loss near highlights         | Phase saturation in bright Y      | ‚úÖ Compensated by soft knee + upper contrast rolloff             |
| Texture erosion                     | Bleed and protection interplay    | ‚úÖ Prevented via HF preservation path and `Protect` gating       |

## Analog-domain improvements

These are improvements that are less deterministic. More a by-product of analog support flaws than a mathematical fix.
But it is deterministic enough to be activate if needed only, and universal for analog videos.

| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Auto dering detector**          | Subcarrier ringing and high-frequency chroma echo from Y/C separation filters   | ‚úÖ Detects oscillation in Cb/Cr across ¬±2 px ‚Üí applies directional 1D Gaussian dering (‚âà20 %) |
| **2. Auto chroma gain compensation** | AGC cross-coupling between luma and chroma amplifiers causing hue drift         | ‚úÖ Measures chroma amplitude vs luma ‚Üí applies proportional gain flattening via `gain_corr`   |
| **3. Auto unclip detector**          | ADC headroom loss: crushed blacks and clipped whites from limited dynamic range | ‚úÖ Detects local min/max bounds ‚Üí restores detail with soft power-curve unclip (0.88 / 1.05)  |



# Vulkan 

Setting vulkan is very simple. It is a GLSL engine for our shader.
In lay terms, it is the language to work on the picture.

What is a bit tricky is that the GLSL version is provided by the vulkan implementation in the GPU driver installation.
So in 2 years it could break. Already, there is a big divide 330/450.
But, fortunately, in practice, 330 or 450 should be higly compatible as we mostly code in very stable, and use only a handful of 2D primitives that are higly compatible.
At home I work with 450. So I rely on you to tell me if something is off. You should really get deep issues if it does not work : black screen, horrible colors, white noise.
